The code could transfer CIFAR10 dataset from bytes file to image file.

(1)Introduction to CIFAR-10
¢Ù CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 colorful images with a size of 32*32. The images are divided into 10 categories. 
There are 50000 training images and 10000 testing images. 
The dataset consists of 5 training batch and one testing batch. Each batch has 10000 images. Testing batch has 1000 images for each categories. 

¢ÚEach batch have a data array and a label array. 
The data array have a size of 10000*3072 with uint8s type.
The image is stored by line.
There are 10000 images in each batch and each image have a siez of 32*32* RGB = 3072.(The first 1024 colomn is red channel, then green and blue channel)
The labels array consists of one list whose dimension is 10000. The indice i refers to the label of related element. 

¢ÛAnother file in the dataset is batches.meta¡£This is a Python dictionary list.
The label_names have 10 elements. The dictionary is a projection onto label names. 
For example, label_names[0] == ¡°airplane¡±, label_names[1] == ¡°automobile".
